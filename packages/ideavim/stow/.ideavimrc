" Add the following command to ~/.ideavimrc: Plug 'machakann/vim-highlightedyank'
" Alternative syntax
" Instructions
" If you want to optimize highlight duration, assign a time in milliseconds:
"
"   let g:highlightedyank_highlight_duration = "1000"
let g:highlightedyank_highlight_duration = "50"

" A negative number makes the highlight persistent.
"

"
"   let g:highlightedyank_highlight_color = "rgba(160, 160, 160, 155)"
